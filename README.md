# NetApp.ONTAP.Monitoring
NetApp ONTAP Monitoring

This is an independent SCOM Management Pack for NetApp ONTAP cluster monitoring.

The code is provided as-is.

Please note, that you must obtain your own copy of NetApp SDK including PowerShell CLI in order to build the MP.

Also note, that library and MP signing key is missing from this repository, so you will have to create your own and put it into the '.key' folder in the root of the repo. 
Also, you will need to change deployable assembly's public keys accordingly.
